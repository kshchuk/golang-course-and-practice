    "# Week 2: Implementing Callbacks in TensorFlow using the MNIST Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lectures you learned how to do classification using Fashion MNIST, a dataset containing items of clothing. There's another, similar dataset called MNIST which has items of handwriting -- the digits 0 through 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will code a classifier for the MNIST dataset, that trains until it reaches 98% accuracy and stops once this threshold is achieved. In the lectures you saw how this was done for the loss but here you will be using accuracy instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes:\n",
    "1. Your network should succeed in less than 10 epochs.\n",
    "2. When it reaches 98% or greater it should print out the string \"Reached 98% accuracy so cancelling training!\" and stop training."

    "- All cells are frozen except for the ones where you need to submit your solutions or when explicitly mentioned you can interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can add new cells to experiment but these will be omitted by the grader, so don't rely on newly created cells to host your solution code, use the provided places for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can add the comment # grade-up-to-here in any graded cell to signal the grader that it must only evaluate up to that point. This is helpful if you want to check if you are on the right track even if you are not done with the whole assignment. Be sure to remember to delete the comment afterwards!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoid using global variables unless you absolutely have to. The grader tests your code in an isolated environment without running all cells from the top. As a result, global variables may be unavailable when scoring your submission. Global variables that are meant to be used will be defined in UPPERCASE.\n",
